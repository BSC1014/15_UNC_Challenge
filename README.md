   - In the above image you can see the trip duration heavily skews towards short trips (5min or less) and drops off heavily after that.

   - Per the above heatmap, most rides are occurring during weekdays, the timing 8am/5pm suggests they are being used heavily for commuting.

   - Gender looks to have no impact on times used (similar across all genders)

   - as evidenced above, most user types tended to be Subscribers. 

## Summary: 
***
   - Overall the results were very interesting, they suggested that most of the bike usage was for commuting and by Males. This can help direct marketing towards non-male audiences and also look for ways to bolster bike access close to places of work. 
   - In terms of future visualizations I would recommend including proximity to help determine if there is a particular location driving usage, I would slo look and see if there are trends amongst rider age.
