## Overview
***
    - The purpose of this analysis was to visualize key demographic details on bike trips to get a better understanding of the times of day the bikes are being used as well as who is using them. 

## Results: 
***

    - picture
    - As noted in the image above there were 2.3m records evidencing a large data set. 
    - picture 
    - As evidenced in the picture above the population is skewed male. 
    - picture
    - In the above image you can see the trip duration heavily skews towards short trips (5min or less) and drops off heavily after that. 
    -Picture 
    - This trend of majority short rides was present across all genders as evidenced in the image above.  
    -Picture
    - Per the above heatmap, most rides are occurring during weekdays, the timing 8am/5pm suggests they are being used heavily for commuting. 
    - pict ure
    - Gender looks to have no impact on times used (similar across all genders)
    -Picture
    - as evidenced above, most user types tended to be Subscribers. 

## Summary: 
***
    - Overall the results were very interesting, they suggested that most of the bike usage was for commuting and by Males. This can help direct marketing towards non-male audiences and also look for ways to bolster bike access close to places of work. 
    - In terms of future visualizations I would recommend including proximity to help determine if there is a particular location driving usage, I would slo look and see if there are trends amongst rider age.
